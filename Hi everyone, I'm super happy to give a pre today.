Hi everyone, I'm super happy to give a pre today.
My topic is about the spatial prediction using black-box models. As you can see from it, I'm trying to do something about spatial analysis and deep learning.

I will briefly introduce two paper works that i'm currently doing, but first let us go through some backgrounds.

- Backgrounds
The understanding of geographical reality can be viewed as a process of spatial data representation and then pattern discovery. There are currently many classic models to represent spatial data, known as the field model, object model and network model. They can be roughly divided into two categories by whether the data is structured in a regular or irregular spatial domain. For ex, regular grids and irregular polygons.

No matter the models, the core issue of spatial analysis remains the same, that we try to understand the spatial dependence and heterogeneity underlying the observed data to make further applications. As Tobler stated in his first law of geography that everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things. This is basically how we make spatial prediction.

So, when trying to capture a geographic phenomenon, we can only collect a limited number of samples, and spatial interpolation is a common prediction method rooted in geostatistics that try to predict the values at unobserved locations given the sample data. 

Since the complex patterns underlying geospatial data are difficult to characterize using basic statistics models, I try to adopt the convolution operation in deep neural networks to animinate spatial dependence and thus consider spatial problems using black-box models. Recalling the different representations of data, the regular and irregular one, our adoptation of deep neural networks should also regard raster convolution and graph convolution, separately.

——PART ONE

The first work I will introduce here is the spatial interpolation based on conditional generative adversarial networks in the regular spatial domain.

The generative adversarial networks (or GAN) is proposed in 2014. I show the basic idea of GAN is this picture. There is a Generator and a Distriminator in the model. Generator is a painter that tries to make fake images to cheat customers, while Discriminator is the detective that continouesly find the fake paintings from the real paintings. Thus in this way, D and G fight each other in an adversarial game, leading to a very powerful generator that can produce paintings really similar to the real ones. 

In the backpropagation, we can use stochastic gradient descending and ascending to simulate the process of training. Then, there comes conditional GAN, which means we give the generator some conditions to base on, like tell him what painting he has to forge.
